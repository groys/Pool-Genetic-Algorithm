SIMULATION checklist
1. include/defines.h set the benchmark function f1/f2/f3/f4
2. if doing a failure simulation in include/defines.h uncomment relevant parts
parts of the following code.
	a. for byzantine simulation, uncomment byzantine_antielitism and set a byzantine_fraction
	b. for crash failure simulation uncomment crashfailure
note that you can only do one type of simulation at a time, i.e. either no failure, crash failure or byzantine
/* Regarding Failures */
//#define CRASHFAILURE                                                        
//#define BYZANTINE_RANDOM      //Inserts random individuals into the pool
#define BYZANTINE_ANTIELITISM   //Writes individual back if it is worse than previous
#define BYZANTINE_FRACTION (0.33)//This always needs to be defined, sim_run needs it

COMPILATION
in src/ make

USAGE
./pool NUM_THREADS RUN_NO < inputfile
./sim_run benchmarkfunction 

RUN
./sim_run f4 will do the simulation for f4
